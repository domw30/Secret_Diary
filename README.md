# Secret Diary

This project was made in line with a Makers Academy Workshop.

The aim of the workshop is to develop and practice TDD skills, taking a User Story and turning this into a Domain Model to test drive.

The expectation is to create tests for a secret diary using lock, unlock, add_entry and get_entry methods.

To use this, clone the repository and run in terminal using irb.
